        Erwin Mill, incorporated by Benjamin N. Duke, was a textile mill that operated between 1893 and 1986. 
        Named after its first manager William H. Erwin, it grew quickly and became one of the largest producers of denim in the world during the 1900s. 
        The first building built on the site was Erwin Cotton Mill No. 1 in 1892.

        Employees at Erwin Mill had some of the best working conditions and the highest wages in textile factories in the southern United States, who later signed union-friendly labor arrangements which were radical to the industry back in the early 20th century. 
        In the years after the mill was built, William Erwin worked to build a mill village for the workers, complete with housing, shops, restaurants, and entertainment. 
        Essentially, he created an environment where the workers would never have to leave, giving them everything they could ever need but also ensuring almost complete control over their lives.
